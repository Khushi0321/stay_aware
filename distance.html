As the spread of COVID-19 continues, communities are being asked to reduce close contact between people. This is called social distancing, and it's an important and effective way to slow down the spread of this virus. Here's why.<br>

<h2>“Social distancing" for all fa​milies</h2>
<p>
Because COVID-19 spreads from person to person, reducing the ways people come in close contact with each other is essential. Social distancing means staying home as much as possible and avoiding crowded, public places where close contact with others is likely. This is why stay at home orders are in place in so many communities, canceling events and gatherings of more than 10 people and closing shops, restaurants and bars. It’s also why many schools have moved to online learning. For essential trips like grocery shopping, the CDC recommends wearing a cloth face covering​ and staying at least 6 feet away from others.​</p>

<h2>Self-isol​​​ation</h2><p>
COVID-19 can spread from person to person even before symptoms start. So, if someone in your family starts to feel even slightly ill, run down, tired, or achy, it's important to stay home and practice “self isolation." This means limiting contact with others. If more severe symptoms develop, like a fever, cough or shortness of breath, call your doctor. They will let you know if a COVID-19 test is needed, and what the next steps should be. If it is believed someone in your family has COVID-19, quarantine will likely be recommended.</p>

<h2>Quara​​ntine</h2><p>
Self-isolation and quarantine both mean you have no contact with the public. However, quarantine is the term used for those who were exposed to a person with COVID-19 but have yet to test positive. These people are asked to stay away from others for 14 days or longer, to make sure they do not spread the virus during this “pre-illness" or incubation period.</p>

<h2>Why social distan​cing is important</h2><p>
Social distancing is an essential way to slow down the spread of COVID-19. And it's important that you follow the social distancing recommendations in your community, whether you're in one of the high-risk groups or not.</p>

​<p>With schools closed and people working from home, it may be tempting to get kids together for pl​aydates or sleepovers, or to think that gatherings of more than 10 people are safe. But social distancing only works if we all participate. And slowing down or preventing the spread of the virus will save lives.​​​​</p>

​<h2>Remem​​ber</h2><p>
The spread of COVID-19 has been rapid and federal, state, and local governments are doing whatever is necessary to protect all of us from getting sick. While most people who become infected will have symptoms similar to a cold or the flu, and children seem less affected by the virus than adults, we all are responsible for protecting those at higher risk. Steps like social distancing may feel like an inconvenience, but it's the best way right now to protect our family, friends, and neighbors who may be vulnerable.</p>

<p>If you are concerned that someone in your family may be at higher risk, you can contact your doctor to discuss what preventative measures may be appropriate for you.</p>







<h1>Cleaning surfaces</h1>
Now is a good time to be extra vigilant with cleaning.


<h3>Why it's important</h3><p>
Like the flu, COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person. The scientific evidence confirms that COVID-19 is spread by droplets. This means that when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, they may generate droplets containing the virus. These droplets are too large to stay in the air for long, so they quickly settle on surrounding surfaces.</p>

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, such as doorknobs.<br>

<h2>How to kill the virus on surfaces</h2>
COVID-19 can remain on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to about 3 days and less than that for other types of surfaces. This will depend on the surface.<br>

If surfaces look visibly dirty, they should be cleaned first. It’s best to use a disinfectant.<br>

<h2>Disinfectants</h2>
Use a disinfectant that is antiviral and remember to store cleaners and disinfectants safely.<br>

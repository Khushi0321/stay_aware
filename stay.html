<h3>Stay at home if you’re sick</h3>
<h4>If you have any of these symptoms :  </h4>

1.A fever<br>
2.Cough<br>  
3.Shortness of breath<br>  
4.Sneezing or a runny nose. <br> 


These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have COVID-19. The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as colds and flu.

<h4>You also need to:  </h4>
1.Stay at home <br> 
2.Avoid close or prolonged contact with people you live with<br>
3.Stay off public transport<br>
4.Stay away from supermarkets and other essential business<br>

<h2>Looking after others</h2>
<h4>Kindness is an incredibly powerful way to show we are united against COVID-19.<br>
You can make a huge difference by:<br>

<p>Checking in on older relatives or vulnerable people over the phone, to make sure they have everything they need
talking to friends and neighbours over the phone to see how they are and if they need support
dropping essential supplies, like food or medications, to those at home. You can leave them at the door.
These kinds of connections and offers of help will go a long way to getting others through COVID-19.</p>

​Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important.</h4>



<h2>Staying mentally healthy</h2>
​Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. It is normal to feel anxious or stressed about COVID-19, or you may feel lonely when you are self-isolating. However, there are lots of things you can do to feel better.<br>

<h2>Top ways to look after your mental wellbeing</h2>
While there are things that we can’t control now, there are things we can do to boost our mental wellbeing and that of your loved ones.<br>

<h3>Stay connected</h3>
This is important for our wellbeing and helps to make us feel safer, less stressed and less anxious. We can support each other to get through this. While we are limiting social contact to contain the spread of COVID-19, there are still lots of ways we can connect.<br>

<h3>Acknowledge your feelings</h3>
It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed, stressed, anxious, worried or scared in the current situation. Allow yourself time to notice and express what you’re feeling. This could be by writing thoughts and feelings down in a journal, talking to others, doing something creative or practising meditation. Talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you’re feeling. Reach out to others.<br>

<h3>Stick to routines where possible</h3>
Try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time, eat at regular times, shower, change your clothes, have regular e-meetings with colleagues or virtual coffee dates with friends and do your chores. Meditating and exercising can help you to relax and have a positive impact on your thoughts. Try not to increase unhealthy habits like comfort eating, drinking, smoking or vaping.<br>

Check-in on other people who might need help.<br>
Reaching out to those who may be feeling alone or concerned can benefit both you and the person receiving support.
